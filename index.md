# Privacy Policy - Article to SNS

**Last updated: February 18, 2026**

## Overview

Article to SNS is a Chrome extension that helps bloggers generate tweet drafts and OGP images from their articles using AI.

## Data Collection

### What we collect
- **Article content**: The text of the blog article on the currently active tab (note.com, zenn.dev, hatenablog.com) is temporarily extracted when you click the "Generate" button.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Your API key is stored locally in Chrome's storage to authenticate with the OpenAI API.

### What we do NOT collect
- We do **not** collect personal information (name, email, etc.)
- We do **not** track browsing history
- We do **not** use cookies or analytics
- We do **not** store any data on external servers

## Data Usage

- **Article content** is sent to the OpenAI API solely to generate tweet drafts. It is not stored or retained after generation.
- **Your API Key** is stored only in your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) and is never transmitted to any server other than the OpenAI API.

## Third-Party Services

This extension uses the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy) to generate tweet suggestions. Your article content is sent to OpenAI's servers for processing. Please refer to OpenAI's privacy policy for details on how they handle data.

## Data Retention

- No data is permanently stored on any server.
- Article content is processed in memory and discarded after tweet generation.
- Your API key remains in Chrome's local storage until you remove it or uninstall the extension.

## Data Security

- All communication with the OpenAI API is encrypted via HTTPS.
- Your API key is stored using Chrome's built-in secure storage mechanism.

## Your Rights

You can:
- Remove your API key at any time through the extension's settings
- Uninstall the extension to delete all locally stored data
- Choose not to use the extension on any page
